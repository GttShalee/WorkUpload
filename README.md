Hopefully, it will be useful to successfully use the git which has upLoad our
work to the itHub repository.I mean, it just a start and there will be more hard
but well, it is true that I have not done this before. It is absolutely new to me

For Now, I just use the html to build the framework of the web, thought it is not 
pretty while a little ugly. Well, I know the computer won't be the math —— the elegant?
Nothing!!! There is just boring and hair losing &-& @-@

Okay, I will go to work, but I need to do some list below:  
* The initial one is to complete the play with all the html  
* Beauty the css which will be unique
* Achieve the function of the upload and download work files
* Have a try to use Python to build the system which can paper_checking ^_^
* Completely transform the web to a framework such as spring or django
* Have a good luck?!

May be the God?
